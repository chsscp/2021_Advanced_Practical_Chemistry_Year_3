    "A **dopant** is a foreign atom that enters the lattice. This can be accidental, e.g. Nuclear fuel contains large concentrations of Fe cations due to the fuel pellets being heated on steel equitment, or it can be by design, e.g. Gadalidium doped ceria is a fuel cell material where Gd cations are added to improve the materials conductivity.
